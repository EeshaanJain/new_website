I'm currently in my third year with my major in Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay. Currently, I am interested in Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning, and have explored various domains through courses and projects including 
- Natural Language Processing
- Reinforcement Learning
- Computer Vision
- Learning with Graphs

Currently I am working under [https://abir-de.github.io/](Prof. Abir De) on privacy-preserving based machine learning and on subset selection.<br>
Apart from AI/ML, I am also interested in Quantum Computing, and Quantum Machine Learning, though I haven't explored QML a lot.<br>
