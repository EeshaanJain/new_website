Whoever is viewing this, hello! Hope you are doing well!<br>
I have a keen interest in Machine Learning - related to optimization, graph neural networks and impactful and fair learning. I am currently working under Prof. [Abir De](https://abir-de.github.io/) at IIT Bombay, and interning with Prof. [Vikas Garg](https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/vikas-garg) at Aalto University.

Each semester I make $$\LaTeX$$ notes of a course. This time it will be for EE761: Advanced Concentration Inequalities.
> Here is a link to the notes I have made for courses or interesting topics: [Notes](notes)

I have acted as a Teaching Assistant in the following courses at IIT Bombay:
1. CS 419M (Introduction to Machine Learning) (_Ongoing_)
2. CS 768 (Learning with Graphs)
3. CS 769 (Optimization for Machine Learning) 
4. MA 207 (Partial Differential Equations)
5. MA 108 (Ordinary Differential Equations)
6. CH 107 (Quantum Chemistry)



I currently study at IIT Bombay, though I hail from Pune, where I have attended my secondary and high school. I can speak English and Hindi fluently, while I am learning Japanese now!

<!-- Oh by the way, I am also trying to maintain a blog [here](blog), in which I seldom post, but mostly its something related to machine learning or algorithms.
 -->

In my free time, I:
- Go for hikes
- Play GeoGuessr/chess
- Read about cultures around the world
