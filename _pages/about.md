**Note:** I am in process of migrating my old website to this one, and it is incomplete as of now.

Whoever is viewing this, hello! Hope you are doing well!<br>
I'm Eeshaan and have a keen interest in Machine Intelligence. I'll keep this page void of any academic topics though, and to know about my academics and interests go over to ![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=academics&color=blue) in the navbar (though I'll add quick links over here).

I currently study at IIT Bombay, though I hail from Pune, where I have attended my secondary and high school. I can speak English and Hindi fluently, while I am learning Japanese and Marathi now! 

Oh by the way, I am also trying to maintain a blog [here](blog), in which I seldom post, but mostly its something related to machine learning or algorithms.

Here are some things that I have pursued as a hobby more or less, and am fascinated by:
- Origami
- Rubik's Cube (Speedcubing)
- Piano
- 3D Animation (Blender)
- Music Visualization

In my free time, I:
- Go for a random walk (pun intended)
- Watch crime/thriller series
- Read news, mainly in the technology domain
- Scroll through Reddit/Twitter/Quora
- Browse at projects/talks which I find cool
- Watch tutorials on Youtube about any random topic

I am inclined towards calm and meaningful music, along with some nightcore. I don't consider having a favorite artist/band but I usually listen to songs from Kina, Sleepy, AURORA and Plain White T's.
