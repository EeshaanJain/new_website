**Note:** I am in process of migrating my old website to this one, and it is incomplete as of now.

Whoever is viewing this, hello! Hope you are doing well!<br>
I have a keen interest in Machine Learning - related to optimization, graph neural networks and impactful data science.

Here is a link to my [Résumé/CV](resume) (Last updated: Jan 2023)



I currently study at IIT Bombay, though I hail from Pune, where I have attended my secondary and high school. I can speak English and Hindi fluently, while I am learning Japanese now!

Oh by the way, I am also trying to maintain a blog [here](blog), in which I seldom post, but mostly its something related to machine learning or algorithms.

Here are some things that I have pursued as a hobby more or less, and am fascinated by:
- GeoGuessr
- Origami
- Rubik's Cube (Speedcubing)
- Piano

In my free time, I:
- Go for hikes or if possible, skiing
- Go for a random walk (pun intended)
- Play chess
- Read news, mainly in the technology domain
- Browse at projects/talks which I find cool
