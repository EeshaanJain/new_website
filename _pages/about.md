Whoever is viewing this, hello! Hope you are doing well!<br>
I have a keen interest in Machine Learning surrounding applications of geometric learning to life sciences. Previously, I have worked on optimization, graph neural networks and impactful and fair learning under Prof. [Abir De](https://abir-de.github.io/) and Prof. [Soumen Charkabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/) IIT Bombay. I have also worked with AWL, Inc. and Sony, Japan, and Google Research for over a year.

I have acted as a Teaching Assistant in the following courses at IIT Bombay:
1. CS 419M (Introduction to Machine Learning) (100+ students)
2. CS 768 (Learning with Graphs) (50+ students)
3. CS 769 (Optimization for Machine Learning: 100+ students) 
4. MA 207 (Partial Differential Equations: 200+ students)
5. MA 108 (Ordinary Differential Equations: 400+ students)
6. CH 107 (Quantum Chemistry: 400+ students)



I currently study at IIT Bombay, though I hail from Pune, where I have attended my secondary and high school. I can speak English and Hindi fluently, while I am learning Japanese now!

<!-- Oh by the way, I am also trying to maintain a blog [here](blog), in which I seldom post, but mostly its something related to machine learning or algorithms.

In my free time, I:
- Go for hikes
- Play GeoGuessr/chess
- Read about cultures around the world
